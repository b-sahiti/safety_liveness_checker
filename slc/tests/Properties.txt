1. Reachability 
    1.1 Universality, Global : G (path)
    1.2 After : F (path)
    1.3 After, Bounded existence : F(path) < k steps
    1.4 Conditional Reachability: : Response

   This property can be per NF or over a set of NF.
   Specification Generation: Find reachability in terms of rules and the add appropriate G or F 
2. Way pointing
    2.1 Presence : Global (Eg: Through a node)
    2.2 Absence : Global (Eg: Never through a node)
3. Modification:
    3.1 After: p -> q
        If src=E is whitelisted then it can reach 
        Specification Generation:  Maybe CTL is better ??? - TODO


4. F(G()): Routing Convergence

5. G and F Combos Check

Property                      Meaning                                             Notation                                                        Formal Representation  Safety Automaton Liveness Automaton
Global Reachability           There is always a feasible path                     G(src=I, dst=D; send())                                            BA                        SBA             LBA
Global non-reachability       There should never be a path                        G(src=I, dst=D; drop())
Future Reachability           Path will exist in future                           F(src=I, dst=D; send())                                             BA                        SBA             LBA
Conditional Reachability      An event will enable a path in future               src=I, dst=D, authentication;drop()  -> F( src=I, dst=D; send())     
                              Eg: After authentication user can reach file server
Immediate reachability        An event will immediately enable a path             src=I, dst=D, authenticated  -> N( src=I, dst=D; drop())  
                              Eg: A authenticated  source will 
                              immediately access file server 
Immediate non-reachability    An event will change state immediately              src=I, dst=D, blacklisted  -> N( src=I, dst=D; drop())  
                              Eg: A black listed source will loose 
                              access to file server immediately
Chain Events                  The system states will change in a specific pattern src=I, dst=D; send(S1) U src=I, dst=D; send(S2) U src=I, dst=D; send(S3) 
                              Eg1: Rate limiter will reduce speed                   
                              from S1 to S2 then to S3 and so on
                              Eg2: Source traffic will be dropped until it is 
                              authenticated and then it will be allowed 

Always in future / After      Once path is established, it will always exist       F(G(src=I, dst=D; send()))
                              Eg: If authenticated, the user can always reach a server    
                               




Table 2:
    classes of properties: Eg: Say how each property can fall into each of the below categories G, F, X

    Absence: G(!p)
    existence: F (p)
    Bounded existence: F(p) in k steps
    Universality: G p
    Precedence: G q before p
    Response: G(p-> (q))
    Chain Precedence:  q1,q2,q3,...p1,p2,p3...
