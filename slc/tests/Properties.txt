1. Reachability 
    1.1 Universality, Global : G (path)
    1.2 After : F (path)
    1.3 After, Bounded existence : F(path) < k steps
    1.4 Conditinal Reachability: : Response

   This property can be per NF or over a set of NF.
   Specification Generation: Find reachability in terms of rules and the add appropriate G or F 
2. Waypointing
    2.1 Presence : Global (Eg: Through a node)
    2.2 Absence : Global (Eg: Never throgh a node)
3. Modification:
    3.1 After: p -> q
        If src=E is whitelisted then it can reach 
        Specification Generation:  Maybe CTL is better ??? - TODO
